HW4: Git, Jupyter and APIs

## Description
The assignment was to use APIs from __[Last FM](https://www.last.fm/api/intro)__ and __[Weather](https://www.weatherapi.com)__ to answer a series of questions using code to extract the information.

## Something you learned in the process
I learned how to hide the API key, practiced for loops and conditional statements, how to add/remove parameters from an API url and
create a list using the .append method. 

## Something you found challenging 
Making sure I got the logic right for the code I wrote and the info I wanted to extract.
Also, keeping track of all the variables and remembering which was used for what.
